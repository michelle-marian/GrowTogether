    <h1>OUR VISION</h1>

    <p> <b>1st goal</b> of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals adopted by the United Nations in <b>2015</b>,
        Sustainable Development Goal 1(SDG 1 or Global Goal 1), advocates for the abolition of all forms of poverty.
        <b>"No Poverty"</b> is the officialphrase. Member countries have vowed to <b>"Leave No One Behind"</b>,
        with the purpose of <b>"leaving no one behind and reaching those who are furthest behind first."</b> 
        SDG 1 aspires to eliminate all forms of severe poverty, such as hunger, lack of safe drinking water, 
        and sanitary conditions. Findinganswers to new challenges posed by climate change and conflict are 
        all part of achieving this aim.
        <br><br><b><h3><i> SDG 1 focuses not just on poor individuals,but also on the services they rely on
        and the social policies that either create or avoid poverty.</b></h3></i>
